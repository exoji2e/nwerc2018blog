Today we used the [ACPC 2018](acpc18.kattis.com) - Alberta Collegiate Programming Contest. This is not a regional contest (direct qualifier for the World Championship - ICPC). The problems are therefore expected to be a bit easier, in the sense that no extremely hard problem is present in the problem set, but there are still some hard problems that few are expected to solve.

In the real contest only 6 out of 8 problems were solved by any team, where one team managed to solve 6 problems.

Both teams managed to solve all eight problems. `iiiii` had never before implemented the algorithm `mincost-maxflow`, but they understood that it was a key part of solving one of the 2 hard problems. They found an implementation online, which was too slow to pass the test cases. They then found another which they with 3 minutes left of the competition managed to get in. Now the implementation is in their notebook.

`from __future__ import solution` was a bit faster, a lot contributed to the fact that they already have an implementation of (and are more familiar with) the `mincost-maxflow` algorithm.

The scoreboard looks very green and nice :)
