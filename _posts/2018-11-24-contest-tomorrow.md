Tomorrow the contest will include around 10 problems with varying difficulty.

The live score board of the competition will be found at [nwerc.eu/scoreboard/public/](http://www.nwerc.eu/scoreboard/public/).

The problems will be possible to find 30 minutes after contest start at the open contest at [open.kattis.com/contests/nwerc18open](https://open.kattis.com/contests/nwerc18open).

Each team is given a work station like this:

![computer]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/imgs/181124/computer.jpg)

This we are not too happy about, it is very narrow between the benches, and it would be very nice with a larger screen, but it's equal for everybody.

Here they should write a program that produces the correct output, for all the secret test cases, for as many problems as possible.

The problems vary a lot in difficulty. For example problem C from the practice contest was very easy and only needed 2 lines of code, but problem B seems very hard and it took 56 minutes before the first team solved it.

You can have a look at the problems from the practice contest in my previous [blog post]({{site.base_url}}/2018/11/24/practice-session-start.html).

During the contest I plan to look at the problems and somewhat rate the difficulty, and report the results.

During the last hour of the real contest (and the last half hour of the practice contest) the score board is frozen, meaning that we can only see that submissions have been sent by the teams, but not if they were correct or not. This is aimed to build some suspense for the award ceremony.

The teams are ranked first by the number of solved problems. If equal they are then ranked by sum of times of their solved problems. The time of a problem is the number of minutes from the start of the contest before the team submitted an accepted solution plus 20 minutes penalty time for each incorrect submission.
