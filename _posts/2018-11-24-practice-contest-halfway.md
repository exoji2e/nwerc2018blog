An hour into the competition most of the teams have solved problem A and C, including both teams from LTH:

Problem B seems hard, and only 2 teams have solved it before the scoreboard freeze (meaning that we can't see if submissions are correct or too slow/incorrect/crashes until the end of the contest).

Worth noting is that `from __future__ import solution` has 14 submissions on problem A because they started the contest with checking the number of opertations per second the judge can handle, which seems to be about `10**9` for `C++` and `3*10**8` for `pypy` (a fast runtime for `python`).
