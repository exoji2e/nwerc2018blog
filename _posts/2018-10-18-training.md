Today we reused the [SWERC](https://swerc.eu/2017) (South Western Europe Regional Competition) 2017 competition, which is comparable in difficulty level to NWERC, and with teams at about the same level. 

Only `from __future__ import solution` had time to train today. The beginning went really well, they solved the 5 easy problems within 2 hours, but the easiest problem was missed and not solved until 108 minutes into the competition. 

Then they got stuck at a dynamic programming problem. At lunch they had, and were ceirtain of, the correct idea for the problem, but something went wrong in the implementation. Jonatan left for lunch, Björn went to a lunch lecture. At 13 (15 minutes left of the competition) Björn returned from the lunch lecture, and thought he knew what was wrong with the solution. Lars asked some questions, that found another bug. With 4 minutes left of the competition they managed to submit an accepted (AC) submission, great work! It always feels nice to get something in just in time for the deadline. 

Looking at the scoreboard from the real competition they would have ended up in 13th place (out of some 120 teams), promising for a medal at NWERC (top 12 is needed). Today we learnt that it's hard to start a competition at 08:15 :).
