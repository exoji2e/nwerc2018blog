Now `from __future__ import solution` has solved problem G!

84 teams have now solved the 3 easier problems. Problem B seems to be a DP in a DAG, which is probably the 4th easiest problem.

I think parsing problem E is a bit tricky, but I still think teams should start solving it soon, given that I have understood the problem correctly. In the problem you are supposed to determine if expressions of sequences of integers always are equivalent. The operations present in the input are `concat`, `sorted` and `shuffle`. I think it's possible to just evaluate the smallest and largest sequences that can be created by the shuffle operations for both sequences. If all 4 sequences are equal the input sequences are always equal, otherwise they can differ. I hope `from __future__ import solution` will find this solution (and that it's correct).

`iiiii` have now also solved problem B, great! A lot of teams have started solving problem C now!
