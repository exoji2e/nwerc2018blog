`from __future__ import solution` solves their next problem - problem C!

6 problems after 2 hours at NWERC is fantastic, very well done!

Problem C is a geometry problem, where there seems to be a greedy solution, but I think it might be a bit tricky to make it pass the tests. `from __future__ import solution` solved it at their first try. I think `iiiii` can solve this problem as well, and hope for a submission soon! The next problem is either E or J.

You can find the problems in the [open competition](https://open.kattis.com/contests/nwerc18open).
