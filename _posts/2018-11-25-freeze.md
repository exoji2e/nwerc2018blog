The scoreboard has been frozen for half an hour, and will be for the remaining 30 minutes of the contest. We will only know if teams submit, not if they solve the problems or not.

`from __future__ import solution` has submitted on both E and J. E is probably solved. They got recursion problems in python, and probably rewrote their solution in `C++`.

Meanwhile Cambridge just submitted on the last problem. We will see in half an hour if they solved all!
