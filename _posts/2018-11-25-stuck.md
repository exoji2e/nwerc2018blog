Now `from __future__ import solution` is submitting on problem J. It has been 1 hour since their last successful submission. Hopefully there soon comes some submissions for problem J and E. Apparently problem A is solved by some more teams now.

`iiiii` have started submitting on G and J as well. Let's hope they are close :)
