Now we have arrived to Eindhoven via train from Amsterdam (we just missed the train in Amsterdam and had to wait for 30 minutes for the next.), checked in at our awesome hostel. `from __future__ import solution` even have a balcony!

Then we went to the registration by foot. The way included walking through a small forest, and a double bicycle roundabout that was inside a car roundabout. It was unclear how it was intended that one should cross by foot, but we cosplayed as bikes, and it went fine.

Eindhoven university of technology looks fancy!

At the registration we got some impossible puzzles. It seems that some force is needed to solve them!
