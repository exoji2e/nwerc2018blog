At NWERC 12 medals are given as prices, 4 golds, 4 silver and 4 bronze. Also the best 4 teams (or 5, or 3, but probably 4) will have the chance to compete in the world finals. However there is a rule that only one team per university is accepted.

That means that even though `from __future__ import solution` was in 5th or 6th place, they were still on an ICPC spot, since the teams above were two from Cambridge and 2 from Oxford. However the second half of the competition has not gone as good for `from __future__ import solution`, before the freeze they were in 18th place. If they manage to solve problem E and J after the freeze (which they have submitted on) there might be a chance to get up to spot 12. However maybe they will need to also solve problem A to get to top 12 for a medal. This year's NWERC seems very tough compared to last year.
