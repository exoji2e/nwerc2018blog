Our trip continues being interesting. The trains did not arrive at Cph Airport. The estimation of one of the trains was consistently 2 minutes before the current time, and 12-15 minutes after for another. This was going on for 40 minutes, until they changed tracks. We went over the tracks and was met by a train that said "Copenhagen". However, the text on the train was wrong and it returned to Sweden. Now we are on a very full train!
