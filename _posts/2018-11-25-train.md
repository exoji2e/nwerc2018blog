**Update2**: Yep. Now there is some error with the track? And we are standing still.

**Update**: The train announced that it's last station was Malmö C one minute before arriving to Malmö C. We were supposed to wait for the Kristianstad train, that they announced in the speakers at 00:15 "The 23:26 train towards Kristainstad is expected to arrive to the platform 00:10". Now at 00:25 we finally sit on the train and the next stop is in Lund. I can't see how this can be messed up, but skånetraffiken might surprise me.

Our trip continues being interesting. The trains did not arrive at Cph Airport. The estimation of one of the trains was consistently 2 minutes before the current time, and 12-15 minutes after for another. This was going on for 40 minutes, until they changed tracks. We went over the tracks and was met by a train that said "Copenhagen". However, the text on the train was wrong and it returned to Sweden. Now we are on a very full train!
