We had an early flight to catch, so I didn't have time to write a blog post after the award ceremony. Unfortunately `from __future__ import solution` did not solve E after the freeze, but they did solve J! Also `iiiii` did solve J after the freeze. Both teams very actually very close to solving problem E. Some downs are to be expected during a competition though.

This resulted in `from __future__ import solution` placing 17th and `iiiii` placing 38th. We would have hoped for a medal, and it looked very promising in the beginning, but 17th is still very good - best Swedish team, second best Nordic team. Last year me, Lars and Johannes placed 17th as well, but I'm certain the teams in general were better this year.

`iiiii` are really good at solving problems compared to the low amount of programming experience they have. 6 problems is a very good result. Too become even better I think they need to practice implementing solved problems faster!

During the freeze `Treenity` from Cambridge solved the only problem they had left, very impressive!

Thanks for following my live reporting of the contest!
