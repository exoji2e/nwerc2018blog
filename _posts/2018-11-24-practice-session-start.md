Now the practice session has started! It features 3 problems and lasts for 1.5 hours. It was planned for 2 hours, but the start was delayed, and the end was not pushed forward accordingly, I guess due to not messing up the entire schedule.

The scoreboard can be found at [this link](http://www.nwerc.eu/scoreboard/public/?static=1).

The problems from the practice session were not available online before this blog post, so I took some photos of them:
