Today was the first day of training!

We decided that next week we will look at treelike data structures, and started off with one out of many trainings where we just pick an old contest and the teams get to solve as many problems as possible. We picked the [North American Qualifiers 2018](https://naq18.kattis.com/).

Since we practice in the evening there is not time enough to do a full 5-hour competition. This meant today that we only got 2 hours to solve 13 different problems. 3 were pretty easy, which all of us solved, and the rest were a lot harder. I myself solved one more problem than the 3 easy. `from __future__ import solution` solved 2 other problems, and `iiiii` had 3 other problems in the air at the end of the contest, all almost solved. `from __future__ import solution` should have seen that the problem I solved was easier than the problems they solved, and `iiiii` need to become better at prioritizing (and faster at coding).
