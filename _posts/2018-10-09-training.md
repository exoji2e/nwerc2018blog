Today was the first day of training!

We decided that next week we will look at treelike data structures, and started off with one out of many training where we just pick an old contest and the teams get to solve as many problems as possible.

Since we practice in the evening there is not time enough to do a full 5-hour competition. This meant today that we only got 2 hours to solve 12 different problems. 3 were pretty easy and the rest were harder. I myself solved one more problem than the 3 easy. `from __future__ import solution` solved 2 other problems, and `iiiii` had 3 problems in the air at the end of the contest, all almost solved. They need to become better at prioritizing (and faster at coding).
