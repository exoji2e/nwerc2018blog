The North Central, North American regional contest took place the 3rd of November, which we reused. After lots of training we have learnt that at least some of the north american contests are quite a lot easier than the european regionals. We should not hope for results like the one today at NWERC, that will make us disappointed, but we can still brag a bit! Both teams did extremely well today, which you can see on the scoreboard. `from __future__ import solution` solved 9 out of 10 problems, including problem A, that noone solved in the real competition. This result would have put them in the top and secured a spot at ICPC. `iiiii` solved 7 problems, which would have put them in spot 4 in the real competition, out of 200 teams. Well done!
