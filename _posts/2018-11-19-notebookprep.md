During NWERC the rules state that you are allowed to bring a notebook, containing 25 pages of printed text. This, a keyboard and a maskot are the only things you are allowed to bring to the contest hall. In the notebook you typically bring your own code of common algorithms that are either hard to remember or easy to mess up when implementing. Creating a notebook is also a great way to establish your knowledge, and pracicing writhing code with your team.

Last week we did some preparations of the notebooks. The plan is that the notebooks will be finished by Wednesday the 21:th of November.

The members of `from __future__ import solution` have been a team for quite a while now, and their notebook is very well studied, where all the code have been rewritten multiple times. You can find their notebook [at github](https://github.com/LarsAstrom/Notebook/blob/master/main.pdf).

`iiiii` did not have any notebook at NCPC, and have just started making one, from my template. They are learning a lot and it will hopefully help them on NWERC!
