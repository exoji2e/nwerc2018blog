This time it was time to practice treelike data structures, which the YouTube channel Algorithms Live have great videos on:
- [Fenwick Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPaJfAUwViY)
- [Segment Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr-xEGoByFQ)
- [Treap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erKlLEXLKyY)

For `iiiii` the focus was Fenwick and Segment trees, in combination with problems solvable by a regular sorted data structure. A good way of training classification of such problems.
`from __future__ import solution` are quite experienced with Fenwick trees already, so their focus was on Treaps. After 2.5 hours they had a correct implementation of a Treap, and solved the first problem. Now they are rewriting the implementation for a nice version to have in their notebook.
