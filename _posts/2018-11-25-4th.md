`from __future__ import solution` solved problem B! Now they are in 4th place!

In the meantime `iiiii` solves the two other easy problems and goes up to 35th place.

Other teams have started solving problem C and there are some submissions to problem J.

I have looked at problem E, and it seems solvable, even though it's not _that_ easy. There seems to be a pretty clear cutoff between problem H, I and K being easier.

NWERC sends will probably send the first 4 teams to ICPC. Top 12 gets a medal. It's too early into the contest to start hoping `from __future__ import solution` going to ICPC, a lot can happen, but it's a very good start! With this start a medal seems pretty likely!
