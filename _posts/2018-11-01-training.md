Today we reused the [SER](https://ser.cs.fit.edu/ser2016/) (South East USA Regional) 2016 competition, it is also at the same level as NWERC, the winners or top 2 teams go to ICPC. However, looking at the results from today it seems in general a lot easier.

`from __future__ import solution` was the only team that had time (in exam period). After 4 hours they had solved 9 problems with an ok time, placing them in second place at SER, if they would have participated in the real competition.

There was a DP problem that needed a few too many submissions because of lazyness. One of the problems was an easy reduction to 2-sat. However `from __future__ import solution` did not have this in their notebook, so they decided that it was ok to look up an implementation, if they also include it in their notebook before NWERC.
