[NWERC 2018](nwerc.eu) - North Western Europe Regional Contest is a yearly programming competition, with participants from the nordics, Germany, UK, the Netherlands and Belgium. About 120 teams participate each year. The top 3-5 of NWERC advance to the international finals ICPC.

The faculty of Engineering at Lund University (LTH) sends 1-3 teams to NWERC each year. 2018 it will take place in Eindhoven, the 23-25th of November.

My name is Måns Magnusson (coach for the teams from Lund University). 2017 I participated at NWERC and our team ended up in 17th place. 

One of my teammates previous teammates, Lars Åström, is 2 years younger and will also this year participate at NWERC in his new team `from __future__ import solution`, which won the student category of NCPC 2018 - the qualifier contest for NWERC, for all of the nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland). This is very promising for NWERC 2018!

The other team that Lund University is sending to NWERC is `¡i¡i¡`, who were not very far behind, placing 10th in the student category (3rd in Sweden) with one less problem solved than `from __future__ import solution`.
